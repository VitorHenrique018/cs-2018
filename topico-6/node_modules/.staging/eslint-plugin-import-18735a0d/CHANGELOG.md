## [2.2.0] - 2016-11-07
### Fixed
- Corrected a few gaffs in the auto-ignore logic to fix major performance issues
  with projects that did not explicitly ignore `node_modules`. ([#654])

## [2.0.1] - 2016-10-06
### Fixed
- Fixed code that relied on removed dependencies. ([#604])

## [2.0.0]! - 2016-09-30
### Added
- [`unambiguous`] rule: report modules that are not unambiguously ES modules.
- `recommended` shared config. Roughly `errors` and `warnings` mixed together,
  with some `parserOptions` in the mix. ([#402])
- `react` shared config: added `jsx: true` to `parserOptions.ecmaFeatures`.
- Added [`no-webpack-loader-syntax`] rule: forbid custom Webpack loader syntax in imports. ([#586], thanks [@fson]!)
- Add option `newlines-between: "ignore"` to [`order`] ([#519])
- Added [`no-unassigned-import`] rule ([#529])

### Breaking
- [`import/extensions` setting] defaults to `['.js']`. ([#306])
- [`import/ignore` setting] defaults to nothing, and ambiguous modules are ignored natively. This means importing from CommonJS modules will no longer be reported by [`default`], [`named`], or [`namespace`], regardless of `import/ignore`. ([#270])
- [`newline-after-import`]: Removed need for an empty line after an inline `require` call ([#570])
- [`order`]: Default value for `newlines-between` option is now `ignore` ([#519])

### Changed
- `imports-first` is renamed to [`first`]. `imports-first` alias will continue to
  exist, but may be removed in a future major release.
- Case-sensitivity: now specifically (and optionally) reported by [`no-unresolved`].
  Other rules will ignore case-mismatches on paths on case-insensitive filesystems. ([#311])

### Fixed
- [`no-internal-modules`]: support `@`-scoped packages ([#577]+[#578], thanks [@spalger])

## [1.16.0] - 2016-09-22
### Added
- Added [`no-dynamic-require`] rule: forbid `require()` calls with expressions. ([#567], [#568])
- Added [`no-internal-modules`] rule: restrict deep package imports to specific folders. ([#485], thanks [@spalger]!)
- [`extensions`]: allow override of a chosen default with options object ([#555], thanks [@ljharb]!)

### Fixed
- [`no-named-as-default`] no longer false-positives on `export default from '...'` ([#566], thanks [@preco21])
- [`default`]: allow re-export of values from ignored files as default ([#545], thanks [@skyrpex])

## [1.15.0] - 2016-09-12
### Added
- Added an `allow` option to [`no-nodejs-modules`] to allow exceptions ([#452], [#509]).
- Added [`no-absolute-path`] rule ([#530], [#538])
- [`max-dependencies`] for specifying the maximum number of dependencies (both `import` and `require`) a module can have. (see [#489], thanks [@tizmagik])
- Added glob option to config for [`no-extraneous-dependencies`], after much bikeshedding. Thanks, [@knpwrs]! ([#527])

### Fixed
- [`no-named-as-default-member`] Allow default import to have a property named "default" ([#507], [#508], thanks [@jquense] for both!)

## [1.14.0] - 2016-08-22
### Added
- [`import/parsers` setting]: parse some dependencies (i.e. TypeScript!) with a different parser than the ESLint-configured parser. ([#503])

### Fixed
- [`namespace`] exception for get property from `namespace` import, which are re-export from commonjs module ([#499] fixes [#416], thanks [@wKich])

## [1.13.0] - 2016-08-11
### Added
- `allowComputed` option for [`namespace`] rule. If set to `true`, won't report
  computed member references to namespaces. (see [#456])

### Changed
- Modified [`no-nodejs-modules`] error message to include the module's name ([#453], [#461])

### Fixed
- [`import/extensions` setting] is respected in spite of the appearance of imports
  in an imported file. (fixes [#478], thanks [@rhys-vdw])

## [1.12.0] - 2016-07-26
### Added
- [`import/external-module-folders` setting]: a possibility to configure folders for "external" modules ([#444], thanks [@zloirock])

## [1.11.1] - 2016-07-20
### Fixed
- [`newline-after-import`] exception for `switch` branches with `require`s iff parsed as `sourceType:'module'`.
  (still [#441], thanks again [@ljharb])

## [1.11.0] - 2016-07-17
### Added
- Added an `peerDependencies` option to [`no-extraneous-dependencies`] to allow/forbid peer dependencies ([#423], [#428], thanks [@jfmengels]!).

### Fixed
- [`newline-after-import`] exception for multiple `require`s in an arrow
  function expression (e.g. `() => require('a') || require('b')`). ([#441], thanks [@ljharb])

## [1.10.3] - 2016-07-08
### Fixed
- removing `Symbol` dependencies (i.e. `for-of` loops) due to Node 0.10 polyfill
  issue (see [#415]). Should not make any discernible semantic difference.

## [1.10.2] - 2016-07-04
### Fixed
- Something horrible happened during `npm prepublish` of 1.10.1.
  Several `rm -rf node_modules && npm i` and `gulp clean && npm prepublish`s later, it is rebuilt and republished as 1.10.2. Thanks [@rhettlivingston] for noticing and reporting!

## [1.10.1] - 2016-07-02 [YANKED]

### Added
- Added new rule [`no-restricted-paths`]. ([#155]/[#371], thanks [@lo1tuma])
- [`import/core-modules` setting]: allow configuration of additional module names,
  to be treated as builtin modules (a la `path`, etc. in Node). ([#275] + [#365], thanks [@sindresorhus] for driving)
- React Native shared config (based on comment from [#283])

### Fixed
- Fixed crash with `newline-after-import` related to the use of switch cases. (fixes [#386], thanks [@ljharb] for reporting) ([#395])

## [1.8.1] - 2016-05-23
### Fixed
- `export * from 'foo'` now properly ignores a `default` export from `foo`, if any. ([#328]/[#332], thanks [@jkimbo])
  This impacts all static analysis of imported names. ([`default`], [`named`], [`namespace`], [`export`])
- Make [`order`]'s `newline-between` option handle multiline import statements ([#313], thanks [@singles])
- Make [`order`]'s `newline-between` option handle not assigned import statements ([#313], thanks [@singles])
- Make [`order`]'s `newline-between` option ignore `require` statements inside object literals ([#313], thanks [@singles])
- [`prefer-default-export`] properly handles deep destructuring, `export * from ...`, and files with no exports. ([#342]+[#343], thanks [@scottnonnenberg])

## [1.8.0] - 2016-05-11
### Added
- [`prefer-default-export`], new rule. ([#308], thanks [@gavriguy])

### Fixed
- Ignore namespace / ES7 re-exports in [`no-mutable-exports`]. ([#317], fixed by [#322]. thanks [@borisyankov] + [@jfmengels])
- Make [`no-extraneous-dependencies`] handle scoped packages ([#316], thanks [@jfmengels])

- [`import/extensions` setting]: a list of file extensions to parse as modules
  and search for `export`s. If unspecified, all extensions are considered valid (for now).
  In v2, this will likely default to `['.js', MODULE_EXT]`. ([#297], to fix [#267])

### Fixed
- [`extensions`]: fallback to source path for extension enforcement if imported
  module is not resolved. Also, never report for builtins (i.e. `path`). ([#296])

## [1.6.1] - 2016-04-28
### Fixed
- [`no-named-as-default-member`]: don't crash on rest props. ([#281], thanks [@SimenB])

  Thanks to [@strawbrary] for bringing this up ([#272]) and adding OSX support to the Travis
  config ([#288]).
